# odin-recipes
This is a simple project from The Odin Project curriculum, more specifically from the HTML Foundations.

Here, our goal was to build a website with different recipes, describing the ingredients and the steps to cook the recipe.

My ideia was to take recipes from animes famous food.

I used the <a href="https://animerecipes.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Anime Recipes</a> tumblr to take the recipes and images, so all the credits for them.
