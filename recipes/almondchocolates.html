            Valentine’s day. No event feels more girly and like a shoujo show than Valentine’s day. In the US, the gifts
            are given by both genders, but in Japan, Valentine’s day is the day for just girls to give chocolates to the
            object of their affections. Of course, there is what’s known as obligatory chocolates–the sweets one is
            expected to give to friends, coworkers, and superiors–but the handmade chocolate is what you are susposed to
            save for that special someone. Sometimes, the distinction between the two types of gifts is a bit confusing,
            and Sawako finds out in the second season of Kimi ni Todoke. However, the chocolates she makes for everyone
            is the perfect simple gift, for Valentine’s day, or otherwise.

        Ingredients:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Packages of Top Ramen</li>
        <li>About 5 cups of pork or beef broth (You can use the stuff in a box, the stuff in a can, or the cubes or the
            paste)</li>
        <li>Pork tenderloin</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Baby bok choy</li>
        <li>1 Green onion</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread all the almonds out on a pan and place in a warm (170°F to 200°F) oven. Let them toast in there until
            they become aromatic.</li>
        <li>Pour all the chocolate chips into the bowl of the double boiler. Add the oil, salt, and vanilla, and let the
            chocolate begin to melt. Stir it occasionally.</li>
        <li>Take ¼ cup of the almonds and chop them finely. Once the chocolate has melted all the way, add the chopped
            almonds, and mix it together.</li>
        <li>
            Set out all the wrappers you’ll need, and slowly begin spooning the chocolate into each wrapper. It can be a
            little messy until you get the hang of it. After filling each wrapper with chocolate, add one or two of the
            whole almonds on top. You can also add sprinkles instead, if you would like.</li>
        <li>Once all the wrappers are full, place them all in the fridge to cool and solidify.</li>
    </ol>
