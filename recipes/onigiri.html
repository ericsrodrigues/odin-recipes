        <p>
            Onigiri itself is a staple food in Japan, simple, portable,
            and filling, making it perfect to take on long adventures to duel gym leaders and Team Rocket. <br>I hope
            you
            enjoy them almost as much a as a box full of donuts!

        Ingredients:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Nori</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked and cooled down, all you have to do is shape them. I have a difficult time with
            this, so what I’ve learned to do is use some plastic wrap. <br>Put a scoop of rice in the middle of the
            plastic
            wrap and wrap it up. <br>Onigiri Variation #1: If you want to make pea onigiri, like in the picture above,
            or
            you want to mix in some furikake, you need to do this before you put the rice in the plastic wrap. <br>Just
            take
            your scoop of rice, put it in a bowl, and mix in your ingredients with a utensil.</li>
        <li>Now, the shaping. Hold the wrapped up rice in your hand. Cup your hand so it looks like a “U”, and then cup
            your other hand, perpendicularly, on top of it tightly. Gently squeeze the rice. <br>If you’re doing it
            correctly, it should start to look kind of like a triangle. Then, rotate the rice ball in your hands, so a
            different point is pointing downward and repeat. <br>Onigiri Variation #2: If you want to add a filling,
            sometime near the end of forming the onigiri, press a dent in the middle of rice with your thumb. <br>Add
            your
            filling, and cover the hole with more rice, and continue forming.</li>
        <li>Take the rice out of the plastic wrap and form it a few times with your bare hands. Then place it on a
            plate, and sprinkle some salt on them. <br>Onigiri Variation #3: You can add nori to just about any type of
            onigiri. You’ll need to cut up the nori to fit, but you can cut it into any shape you want, <br>be it a
            larger
            sheet to cover the entire onigiri, a small little rectangle for just on the bottom, or some cute shapes.
            <br>Onigiri Variation #4: In addition to the salt, you can sprinkle some sesame seeds or furikake on top,
            and
            press it into the rice. <br>Onigiri Variation #5: Finally, one of my favorite types of onigiri, yaki
            onigiri, or
            grilled onigiri. Now, I don’t have the appropriate small grill to make these, so I make them in the oven.
            <br>Just heat your oven up to a low heat, brush some soy sauce onto one side of the onigiri, place it on a
            cookie sheet, and put it in the oven. In 10-20 minutes, flip the onigiri over, <br>and brush some more soy
            sauce
            onto the other side, and cook it again. Just keep an eye on it, and cook it until it’s slightly crispy on
            both sides.
